# Changelog

One version across `@origingame/engine` (the knowledge inside it as
`knowledge/`), `@origingame/engine-darwin-arm64`, `@origingame/engine-linux-x64`
and `@origingame/create-game` (docs/release.md §3). Before 1.0.0 a minor
bump carries API additions or changes, one line each, written at the merge
that changes `crates/og-api/api.ogt`; a patch bump carries fixes and frames.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-22)

- Fix: the published template, archetypes and knowledge scaffold carried no
  `.gitignore` (npm drops the file from every tarball), so a scaffolded game
  and the platform's overlay had none. Stored as `gitignore` in the packages
  and written back as `.gitignore` by `create-game` and the knowledge mount,
  as `gitattributes` already was. The install test checks both files.
- No API change.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-22)

The first published version: the API as `crates/og-api/api.ogt` stands at
the tag (modules math, reflect, world, system, game, transform, time, rng,
input, camera, render, load, physics, atmosphere, anim, tween, tilemap,
audio, nav, ai, platform, i18n, ui, systems, commands, probe, terrain,
stream), the `og` tool (run, dev, test, polish, build, cook, probe, check,
sfx, skin, doctor, api), the project template and eight archetypes, the
ten `og-*` skills and the generated wiki. Everything before it is the
build-out recorded in `docs/phase-1.md`.
