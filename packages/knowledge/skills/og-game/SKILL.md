description: Building a game on Origin Engine — the project layout, components and systems on the ECS, the game entry, scenes as .ogt text, assets cooked from assets/ to cooked/, the og.load loaders, effects, fog, sky, day and night, weather and water, material shaders in WGSL, and physics beyond rigid bodies (joints, character and platformer controllers, vehicles, ropes, cloth, 2D fluids, ragdolls). Use when creating, structuring or extending a TypeScript Origin Engine game (a project with a project.ogt; not a Godot project.godot).
---

An Origin Engine project is plain files: TypeScript in `src/`, source assets
in `assets/`, text scenes, and a manifest. `npm create @origingame/game`
produces it; everything after that is code and text, never an editor.

## The project

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `project.ogt` | The manifest: `name`, `id`, the pinned `engine` version, `entry`, `profile` (`2d` or `3d`), `tick`, `seed`, `scenes`, the first `scene`, `publish` settings |
| `src/main.ts` | The game entry: its default export is `og.game({...})` |
| `assets/` | Source assets: glTF models, PNG/JPEG textures, WAV sounds, TTF/OTF fonts, `.ogt` scenes, and `<file>.ogt` import settings |
| `cooked/` | `og cook` output (`.ogb` blobs and `.cook.ogt`); never committed, the only thing the runtime reads |
| `tests/*.og.ts` | Playtest scripts `og test` runs headless |
| `dist/` | `og build` output |

The engine version in `project.ogt` is a pin. Upgrading it is an explicit
change with its own run, never a side effect.

## Components, resources, systems, the game

```ts
import { og, defineComponent, defineSystem, f32, Vector3 } from "@origingame/engine";

export const Health = defineComponent("Health", { hp: f32(100, { min: 0, max: 1000, tunable: true }), max: f32(100) });
export const Velocity = defineComponent("Velocity", { v: Vector3() });

export const Move = defineSystem("Move", { reads: [Velocity], writes: [og.Transform] }, (q, time) => {
  for (const a of q.archetypes()) {
    const p = a.column(og.Transform).position;
    const v = a.column(Velocity).v;
    for (let i = 0; i < a.count * 3; i++) p[i] += v[i] * time.dt;
  }
});

export default og.game({
  tick: 60,
  scenes: { main: "scenes/main.ogt" },
  systems: [Move],
  commands: { spawn_wave: (world, args) => spawnWave(world, Number(args[0])) },
});
```

- A **component** is plain data per entity; a **resource** is a reflected
  singleton (tuning tables, game state) read with `world.resource(token)`.
  Engine-owned ones are tokens on `og`: `og.Transform`, `og.Time`, `og.Rng`,
  `og.Input`, `og.Camera`.
- A **system** is a function over its matched archetypes, once per tick
  (`og-core` has the rules). Keep each system to one job; share state through
  components and resources, never module variables.
- **Entities** are spawned with `world.spawn({ name, parent, position })` and
  addressed by name everywhere outside the hot loop: `world.find(name)`, the
  probe's ids, `teleport`, `set`, `dump_entity`. Give every entity a person
  will ask about a stable name.
- **Commands** in `GameDesc.commands` are snake_case actions the command
  channel and playtests can call (`0.5:spawn_wave:3`). Add one for each
  state a test needs to reach quickly, instead of playing there.
- **Facts** (`GameDesc.facts`) return a small JSON object for the probe's
  `state()`: score, phase, lives. Tests assert on facts and dumps.

## Scenes are text

A scene is an `.ogt` file under `assets/`, cooked like any asset:

```text
type scene
version 1
---
name "Main"
entity "ship" {
  model "models/dropship.glb"
  Transform {
    position 0 1.5 0
  }
  entity "light" {
    Transform {
      position 0 3 0
    }
  }
}
```

Each `entity` has a name, optional `model` (a glTF under `assets/` whose
default scene becomes the entity's children), component blocks keyed by the
component's reflected name with one line per field, and nested child
entities. Fields not written take their defaults. Edit scenes as text and
diff them like code; the cook checks field names and lane counts against the
registered schema and refuses a model path that does not exist.

## Assets: assets/ to cooked/

- Put sources in `assets/`; `og cook` turns them into `cooked/`: glTF into
  meshopt-compressed meshes with LODs, textures into KTX2 Basis Universal
  (ETC1S for colour, UASTC for normal and linear maps), WAV into QOA, fonts
  into MSDF atlases, scenes into component tables. Import settings live next
  to the source as `<file>.ogt` (`texture { kind normal }`,
  `font { charset latin chars "开始游戏" }`).
- Declare the characters a font must show (`chars`) rather than cooking a
  whole CJK charset: the full set is several times the size of the font.
- Reusable production assets come through the platform's asset catalog into
  `assets/`; record each file's licence next to it.

## Loading

`og.load.*` returns a handle at once and completes at a tick boundary; under
`og run` and in replays every load completes before the next tick, so the
tick it lands on is deterministic. Paths are asset ids (the path under
`assets/`). Check `og.load.status` (or the `AssetReady` / `AssetFailed`
events) before using an asset, and spawn a loaded scene or model with
`world.instantiate(asset, { name, position })`. The scene in
`GameDesc.scene` is spawned for you when the world starts. The wiki's `load`
page lists every loader and what each returns.

## 2D: sprites, flipbooks, tilemaps

- **Sprites** are components: an entity with `og.Transform` and `og.Sprite`
  (`width`, `height`, `anchor`, `color`, `opacity`, `layer`, `sortY`,
  `flipX`, `flash`, `shadow`, nine-slice `sliceX`/`sliceY`) is drawn every
  frame at its transform, its scale multiplying the size (so squash and
  stretch is a tween of `og.Transform.scale`). `og.render.sprite` stays for
  one-tick, immediate drawing (HUDs, debug).
- **Sprite sheets** are `.ogt` files of `type flipbook` next to the PNG
  (grid or named frames, or an Aseprite / TexturePacker JSON `atlas`; clips
  with `fps`, `mode loop | pingPong | once` and `event <frame> "name"`).
  `og.load.flipbook(world, "sprites/hero.ogt")` answers the sheet and its
  clips; `og.Flipbook { sheet, clip: og.anim.clip(info, "walk") }` on the
  sprite's entity plays it, and `og.FlipbookEvent` reports the frames named
  by `event` (footsteps, the frame a hit lands). Give pixel art
  `texture { kind pixel }` import settings (lossless, nearest).
- **Tilemaps**: a tileset `.ogt` (`type tileset`: grid, `solid` tiles,
  `collide` rects, animated tiles, `terrain` auto-tiling rules) and a map:
  a Tiled `.tmj`, an LDtk `.ldtk` or a hand-written `.ogt` of `type tilemap`
  (layers of rows, objects). `og.load.tilemap` answers its layers and
  objects; an entity with `og.Tilemap { map }` draws it from its position
  (top-left corner) and gives the collision layers static colliders.
  `og.tilemap.setTile` edits a cell (terrain layers re-tile their
  neighbours, colliders follow); `getTile`, `cellAt`, `cellCenter` read it.
  Layers scroll by their `parallax`; `repeat x` tiles a background.

## Feel: tweens, time scale, camera

- `og.tween.to(world, { entity, component, field: "position.y", to: [2],
  duration, ease, delay, loops, yoyo })`, `og.tween.sequence` and
  `og.tween.parallel` animate any numeric component field; `og.TweenCompleted`
  reports the end; `og.tween.squash` and `og.tween.flash` are the presets.
- `og.time.hitStop(world, ticks)` and `og.time.setScale(world, s)` slow or
  freeze physics, animation, flipbooks and tweens while input and the UI
  keep going; move your own gameplay by `time.scaledDt`.
- `og.camera.shake(world, trauma)` (decays by itself), `og.camera.kick`,
  `og.camera.punch`; `og.Follow2D` has a dead zone, look-ahead and per-axis
  smoothing, `og.CameraZone` keeps the view in a room, `og.CameraRail`
  moves it along a spline.
- `og.render.floatingText(world, { text: "-12", position, color })` pops a
  damage number or a pickup text that rises and fades by itself.
- How much of each (hit stop by impact, shake by event, squash amounts,
  easing by intent, frame rates by action) is the **og-feel** skill.

`templates/archetypes/topdown` (a Zelda-like room: a Tiled map with
auto-tiled walls and collision, a 4-direction flipbook hero, an enemy with
a hurt flash and knockback, pickups with floating text, a door),
`templates/archetypes/runner` and `templates/archetypes/match3` use all of
this.

## Input

`world.resource(og.Input)` is the keyboard, the mouse and the first touch
(`down("KeyW")`, `pressed`, `axis`, `buttonDown`). Two more resources carry
what one pointer cannot: `og.Pointers` (pointer 0 is og.Input's, 1 to 4
further touches: `down(id)`, `pressed(id)`, `position(id)`, `start(id)`)
and `og.Gamepad` (up to four pads: `connected(pad)`, `down("a", pad)`,
`pressed`, `released`, `axis("leftX", pad)`; sticks are y down). All three
are world state, so playtests and replays reproduce them; script them with
`touch:<id>:<down|move|up>:<x,y>` and `gamepad:<a+b|->[:lx,ly][:lt,rt]`.

## Effects

Every effect is off until the game turns it on, as data:

- **Post** — the `og.PostEffects` resource: `ao`, `outline`,
  `depthOfField`, `motionBlur`, `godRays`, `glow`, `lut` (a handle from
  `og.load.lut(world, "luts/look.cube")`), `vignette`,
  `chromaticAberration`, `filmGrain`, `flash`, and camera shake through
  `shakeTrauma` (set it on a hit and let it decay). A game with fast motion
  wants `render: { antialias: "taa" }` in `og.game`.
- **Particles** — an emitter is an `.ogt` asset of `type particles`
  (rate, bursts, lifetime, speed, curves, collision; cooked like any asset)
  loaded with `og.load.emitter`; an entity with `og.ParticleSystem
  { emitter, seed, startTick }` emits it at its transform. Particles are
  drawn by the renderer from the tick, deterministic and never part of the
  simulation.
- **Trails and beams** — components `og.Trail` (follows the entity) and
  `og.Beam` (between two points); `og.render.ribbon(world, desc)` draws a
  polyline this tick.
- **Decals** — `og.Decal` projects an atlas rectangle
  (`og.RenderSettings.decalAtlas`) onto what its box covers.
- **2D lighting** — `og.Lighting2D` (ambient, the lit layer range),
  `og.Light2D` and `og.Occluder2D` components, `castShadow` on sprites;
  sprites also take `flash`, `glow` and `blend`.
- **Materials** — toon, rim, dissolve, hit flash and outline are
  `og.render.standardMaterial` fields; animate them with
  `og.render.updateMaterial(world, material, { dissolve: t })`.
- **HUD** — `og.render.sprite` / `og.render.text` with `screen: true` draw
  in CSS pixels from the top-left over the finished frame, untouched by
  post effects, with an optional `clip`; `og.ui` uses the same layer.

`templates/fx-showcase` shows every one of these on its first five stations. Camera
shake for gameplay is `og.camera.shake` (it decays by itself);
`PostEffects.shakeTrauma` holds a fixed shake.

## Atmosphere and water

`og.atmosphere` is data too, and off until set (`reference/atmosphere.md`):

- **Fog** — the `og.Fog` resource: `enabled`, distance fog (`density` per
  metre from `start`, or a linear ramp to `end`), height fog
  (`heightDensity` below `height`, thinning by `falloff`), `sunColor` for
  the glow looking into the sun, `sky` for how much of the sky it covers.
- **Sky** — `og.Sky { enabled, zenith, horizon, ground, sunDirection,
  sunColor, sunSize, glow, stars }` draws the sky per pixel and lights the
  scene by it.
- **Day and night** — `og.DayNight { enabled, start, speed, tilt, azimuth }`:
  the clock is `start + seconds × speed` hours from the tick, so it replays;
  it drives the first `og.DirectionalLight` (the sun by day, a dim moon by
  night), the sky, the ambient light and the fog's tint. Read the clock with
  `og.atmosphere.timeOfDay(world)` (declare `og.DayNight` among the system's
  reads) to light lamps at dusk.
- **Weather** — `og.Weather { kind: WEATHER_RAIN | WEATHER_SNOW |
  WEATHER_DUST | WEATHER_MIST, intensity, wind, radius }`: particles around
  the camera, the preset's fog (an enabled `og.Fog` wins) and dimmed light.
  With an orthographic camera the particles are 2D sprites on `layer`.
- **Water** — `og.Water` on an entity draws a surface on its xz plane
  (`size`, `shallow`/`deep` colours over `depthFade`, `foamWidth` where it
  meets geometry, `waveStrength`, `reflectivity`); with an
  `og.WaterSurface` on the same entity its waves move the surface and bodies
  splash it (`og.Splash` events) and float. In 2D, `og.WaterLine` with
  `og.Water2D` is a side-on pool drawn in the sprite order.

## Material shaders

A material can run your own WGSL in four hooks of the lit shader. Write the
hooks in a `.wgsl` file and declare it in an `.ogt` of `type shader`:

```text
type shader
version 1
---
source "shaders/dissolve.wgsl"
param amount float 0
param edgeColor color 4 1.6 0.4
```

```wgsl
// Any of the four; the others stay the identity.
fn vertex_offset(h: Hook, p: Params) -> vec3<f32>                  // world-space offset
fn surface_color(h: Hook, p: Params, c: vec4<f32>) -> vec4<f32>    // base colour and alpha
fn surface_normal(h: Hook, p: Params, n: vec3<f32>) -> vec3<f32>   // world normal, unit length
fn surface_emissive(h: Hook, p: Params, e: vec3<f32>) -> vec3<f32> // emitted light
// h: world, local (object-space) position, normal, uv, color, time (s).
// p: the declared parameters by name (p.amount). value_noise3(p, seed) is
// the engine's 3D value noise (0..1).
```

The cook compiles every shader for every back end (WebGPU, Metal, Vulkan,
and GLSL ES for WebGL2) and refuses one that does not compile with naga's
message, its lines counted in your hooks. In the game:
`og.render.shaderMaterial(world, must(og.load.shader(world,
"shaders/dissolve.ogt")), { color, alphaTest: 0.5 })` makes the material,
`og.render.setShaderParam(world, material, "amount", [0.4])` sets a
parameter. Alpha below `alphaTest` discards the fragment (a dissolve);
shadows and the depth prepass use the mesh undisplaced; skinned meshes draw
without the hooks. `templates/fx-showcase/assets/shaders/` has a dissolve
and wind-swayed grass.

## Physics beyond rigid bodies

All are components over the same simulation, deterministic and part of
snapshots (`reference/physics.md`):

- `og.Joint` — fixed, hinge (`JOINT_REVOLUTE`, limits, a velocity or
  position motor), slider, spring, rope, ball; to another body (`other`) or
  a world point (`otherAnchor`); `value` reads the angle or slide.
- `og.CharacterController` (3D or top-down) — set `move` every tick and
  `jump` to jump; it climbs `maxSlope` and `stepHeight`, snaps to the
  ground, rides moving platforms, pushes bodies; read `grounded`,
  `velocity`, `ground`.
- `og.PlatformerController` (2D) — `moveX`, `jump`, `down` in; jump height
  and time to apex, coyote time, jump buffer, wall jumps, one-way layers,
  corner correction as tunables (og-feel §12 has values by genre);
  `og.CharacterEvent` reports jumps and landings for dust and sounds.
- `og.Vehicle` — a raycast car (3D, `throttle`, `steer`, `brake`; wheels
  from `og.physics.vehicleWheels`) or a car on wheel joints (2D).
- `og.Rope` and `og.Cloth` — Verlet, drawn by the engine when `visible`;
  `og.Fluid2D` — a particle fluid drawn as metaballs on a sprite layer.
- `og.Ragdoll` — give the entity a rig
  (`og.physics.setRagdollRig(world, e, must(og.physics.ragdollRigFromSkeleton(world, anim.skeleton)))`),
  then set `weight` 1 to go limp; its model is drawn blended from the
  animation to the bones over `blendTime`.

Readouts (`ropePoints`, `clothPoints`, `fluidParticles`, `waterHeight`,
`vehicleWheels`, `ragdollPose`) show the last step. `templates/fx-showcase`
has a station for each.

## Where to look things up

`reference/index.md` (the generated wiki shipped with this skill) maps every
module, type and function to its page, with the IDL text, defaults, ranges
and units of every field.
