### `og.load.animation`

Load a cooked glTF's animation (its `<model>#anim` blob: the rig, the clips, the skin and morph streams) and register its skeleton and clips with og.anim. Loading the same model again answers the same handles.

Clips are cooked as f32 samples or, with `animation { compress true }` in the model's import settings, as quantised keys within a tolerance; either way every frame is rebuilt here and the clip plays as f32. Morph targets are cooked sparse.

See `loading §7`.

```ts
og.load.animation(world: World, path: string): Result<Animation>
```

| Parameter | Type | Optional | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| `world` | `World` | no | The world whose animation owns the assets. |
| `path` | `string` | no | The model's asset id, such as `models/walker.glb` (a `#anim` suffix is accepted). |

**Returns** `Result<Animation>`: Refused for an uncooked path, a model the cook wrote no `#anim` blob for (no skins, clips or morph targets), a cook stamp mismatch or an invalid rig.
