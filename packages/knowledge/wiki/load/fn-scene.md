### `og.load.scene`

Load a cooked scene (.ogt). world.instantiate spawns its entities: depth first, parents before children, each component table matched to a registered component by its reflected name (`Transform` is og.Transform) and migrated field by field; a field the scene lacks keeps its default, one the component lacks is dropped with a warning.

```ts
og.load.scene(world: World, path: string): Result<Asset>
```

| Parameter | Type | Optional | Doc |
|---|---|---|---|
| `world` | `World` | no | The world that owns the asset. |
| `path` | `string` | no | The scene's asset id, such as `scenes/main.ogt`. |

**Returns** `Result<Asset>`.
